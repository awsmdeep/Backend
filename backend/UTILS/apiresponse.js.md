### **Code Overview**

The `ApiResponse` class is a standardized way to format responses in an API. It ensures consistency in how data, messages, and status codes are returned to the client, making it easier to manage and understand API responses.


1. Define the `ApiResponse` Class
```
class ApiResponse {
    // Constructor to initialize the response object
    constructor(statusCode, data, message = "Success") {
        // Initialization logic here
    }
}

```

- **class ApiResponse**: This defines the `ApiResponse` class, which will encapsulate the structure of an API response.
- **constructor()**: The constructor method is used to create and initialize an `ApiResponse` object with the given parameters:
    - **statusCode**: An HTTP status code representing the outcome of the API request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server error).
    - **data**: The data to be included in the response, which could be any relevant information or object returned from the API.
    - **message**: A human-readable message describing the response. It defaults to `"Success"` if no message is provided.

2. Set Properties of the `ApiResponse` Object:
```
// HTTP status code for the response
this.statusCode = statusCode;

// Data to be included in the response
this.data = data;

// Message describing the response, defaults to "Success"
this.message = message;

// Success flag, true if statusCode is less than 400 (indicating a successful response)
this.success = statusCode < 400;

```

- **this.statusCode = statusCode**: Stores the HTTP status code in the `ApiResponse` object.
- **this.data = data**: Stores the data that will be included in the response. This can be any information that the API needs to return to the client.
- **this.message = message**: Stores the message describing the outcome of the API request. If no message is provided, it defaults to `"Success"`.
- **this.success = statusCode < 400**: A boolean flag that indicates whether the response was successful. If the `statusCode` is less than 400 (e.g., 200, 201, 204), `success` is set to `true`. Otherwise, it's set to `false` (for error responses like 400, 404, 500).

3. Export the `ApiResponse` Class:

```
// Export the ApiResponse class for use in other modules
export { ApiResponse };

```

- **export { ApiResponse }**: This line exports the `ApiResponse` class so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application. By doing this, you can create consistent response objects throughout your API.

### **Summary for Revision**

- **Class Purpose**: The `ApiResponse` class is designed to standardize the structure of API responses, ensuring consistency across the application.
- **Key Components**:
    - **statusCode**: HTTP status code indicating the result of the API request.
    - **data**: The payload or information to be returned to the client.
    - **message**: A descriptive message about the API response, defaulting to `"Success"`.
    - **success**: A boolean flag indicating success (`true` for status codes < 400).
- **Usage**: Use this class to create uniform API responses that include the status code, data, and a message, making your API responses predictable and easier to manage.

```
// Class to standardize API responses
class ApiResponse {
    // Constructor to initialize the response object
    constructor(statusCode, data, message = "Success") {
        // HTTP status code for the response
        this.statusCode = statusCode;
        
        // Data to be included in the response
        this.data = data;
        
        // Message describing the response, defaults to "Success"
        this.message = message;
        
        // Success flag, true if statusCode is less than 400 (indicating a successful response)
        this.success = statusCode < 400;
    }
}

// Export the ApiResponse class for use in other modules
export { ApiResponse };
