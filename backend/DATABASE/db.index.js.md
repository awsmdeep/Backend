### **Code Overview**

This code establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library. It handles both successful connections and errors, ensuring that the application can either proceed with a connected database or fail gracefully.

1. Import Necessary Modules:

```
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { DB_NAME } from "../constant.js";

```

- **mongoose**: A popular MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, used to define schemas and interact with the database.
- **DB_NAME**: A constant imported from a separate module (`constant.js`) that holds the name of the database.

2. Define the `connectDB` Function:
```
const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        // Connection logic here
    } catch (error) {
        // Error handling logic here
    }
}

```

**connectDB**: An asynchronous function designed to connect to the MongoDB database.

3. Attempt to Connect to MongoDB:

```
const connectionInstance = await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/${DB_NAME}`);

```

- **mongoose.connect()**: A method to initiate the connection to MongoDB.
    - **`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/${DB_NAME}`**: The connection string constructed using environment variables and the database name.
        - **`process.env.MONGODB_URI`**: The base URI for MongoDB, typically stored in environment variables for security.
        - **`DB_NAME`**: The name of the specific database to connect to, imported from the `constant.js` file.
- **connectionInstance**: Holds the instance of the connection if successful.

4. Log Success or Error:

**Success Case**:
```
console.log(`MongoDB connected || DB_HOST: ${connectionInstance.connection.host}`);

```

Logs a success message including the host name of the MongoDB server if the connection is successful.

**Error Handling**:
```
console.log("MONGODB ERROR:", error);
process.exit(1);

```

- Logs an error message if the connection fails.
- **process.exit(1)**: Exits the Node.js process with a failure code (`1`) to indicate that the connection attempt was unsuccessful. This prevents the application from continuing to run without a database connection.

5. Export the `connectDB` Function:

```
export default connectDB;

```

- **export default connectDB**: Exports the `connectDB` function as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

### **Summary for Revision**

- **Function Purpose**: Establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- **Key Components**:
    - **Mongoose**: Used for database connection and management.
    - **Connection String**: Combines the base URI from environment variables with the database name from a constant.
    - **Error Handling**: Logs errors and exits the process if the connection fails.
- **Usage**: The `connectDB` function is called to initiate a connection to the MongoDB database before starting the application server.

### **Full Code**

```
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { DB_NAME } from "../constant.js";

// Asynchronous function to connect to MongoDB
const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        // Attempt to connect to MongoDB using the connection string from environment variables and the database name from constants
        const connectionInstance = await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/${DB_NAME}`);
        
        // Log a success message if the connection is successful
        console.log(`MongoDB connected || DB_HOST: ${connectionInstance.connection.host}`);
    } catch (error) {
        // Log an error message if the connection fails
        console.log("MONGODB ERROR:", error);
        
        // Exit the process with a failure code
        process.exit(1);
    }
}

// Export the connectDB function as the default export
export default connectDB;

```
